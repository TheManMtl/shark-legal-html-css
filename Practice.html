        <p>A charge for any theft-related crime in California must be taken very seriously because it can lead to a wide
          range of potential penalties, including jail time.</p>
        <p>
          Embezzlement is a particular type of theft whereby someone deprives a person of their property by unlawfully
          taking it after it has been entrusted to them, usually by an employer.
        </p>
        <p>
          This type of offense is viewed severely by the criminal justice system as it involves an abuse of trust. The
          victim is often an employer, business partner, or person who entrusted assets to another person by necessity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Apart from the immediate penalties for a potential felony crime, the criminal record you are saddled with can
          have long-term and life-changing consequences if convicted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Taking prompt and decisive steps to defend against the charge is, therefore, essential if you have been
          charged with embezzlement.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our experienced embezzlement attorneys at The Law Offices of Bryan R. Kazarian in Orange County will defend
          your rights, guide you through the process, and try to prevent the charge from negatively impacting the rest
          of your life.
